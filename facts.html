                      <p>Force and momentum are intimately related. Force acting over time can change momentum, and Newton’s
                        second law of motion can be stated in its most broadly applicable form in terms of momentum. Momentum
                        continues to be a key concept in the study of atomic and subatomic particles in quantum mechanics
                        aswell.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Newton’s second law of motion in terms of momentum states that the net external force equals the
                        change in momentum of a system divided by the time over which it changes.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In symbols, Newton’s second law of motion can be defined as: <br>
                         Fnet=<sup>ΔP</sup>&frasl;<sub>ΔT</sub>
                        <br>
                        Fnet is the net external force, Δp is the change in momentum, and Δt is the change time.

                      <p>Linear momentum (momentum for brevity) is defined as the product of a system’s mass multiplied by its velocity.
                      <br>
                         <br>
                        With this information we can find the momentum of specific systems, for example Mike Tyson's punch.
                        <br>
                         <br>
                        Mike Tyson's punch power is 1,600 joules. Now, when he punches an opponent the momentum from his fist is transferred to his opponents body.
                         <br>
                         <br>
              A fist travels with a specific velocity towards an opponent with a mass. The product of the mass and velocity is the momentum. This is p=mv, the equation for momentum.

                          <p>Vehicles are an excellent example of momentum as most of all safety of driving a car is momentum.<br>
                          <br>
                          For example, in car accidents cars experience a massive change in momentum as they go from a high speed to a full stop. The force of such a collision can be enormous and potentially fatal. The theorem (Fnet=<sup>ΔP</sup>&frasl;<sub>ΔT</sub>) tells us that if we can increase the amount of time it takes for the passenger’s momentum to become zero, we can reduce the amount of force the passenger experiences. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                          When an airbag deploys in an accident, it reduces the force on the person by slowing them down more gradually than if they were to hit the much harder dashboard. By increasing the time it takes to stop the person, the airbag decreases the force the passenger experiences and saves lives.

                        Linear momentum equation is P=mv
                          <br>
                          <br>

                        Momentum is directly proportional to the object’s mass and also its velocity. Momentum, P, is a vector having the same direction as the velocity, v. <br> The SI unit for momentum is p=kg⋅<sup>m</sup>&frasl;<sub>s</sub>

                          <br>
                          A pendulum showcases momentum through its swinging motion. As it swings back and forthm it continually exchanges kinetic energy and potetional energy, demostrating the conservation of momentum within the system.
